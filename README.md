# Python RPG Game

## Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/krunchiekrunch/python-rpg-game
cd python-cli-rpg-game
python main.py
```

## Notes

There are 4 types of actions
* **Attack:** Deals damage between 8 and 12. (Attack power -2 and +2).
* **Defend:** Reduces incoming damage by your defense. (You will still take damage, but just less of it)
* **Special Attack:** Deals damage between your 20 and 30. (Attack power x2 and x3)
* **Heal:** Restores your HP by a random amount between 5 and 10.

Attack power is 10 for the player and 8 for the blob, this is customisable on line 19 and 20

Each round, there is a 30% chance that the special attack option is provided (Customisable on line 56)
